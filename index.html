        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a visual effect where the background of a web page appears to stay still while the
            foreground shifts vertically or horizontally. Parallax scrolling is used to add visual interest to a website
            and engage users as they scroll through a web page.

            In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background typically
            moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of depth. Done correctly, parallax scrolling produces a
            fascinating and seamless virtual experience.

            If you want to add a parallax scrolling effect to your website, you should consider the following tips.
            Are you inspired to take your website to the next level with parallax scrolling?

            Though it may seem overwhelming to implement the code required to get it right, using CSS to create this
            animation keeps things simple.
            There are several ways you can incorporate parallax scrolling into your website with CSS. The most
            straightforward approach involves using a container element to set a particular height for a background
            image.

            You can create a parallax scrolling effect in WP in multiple ways. You can either code your new parallax
            section into your website code, install a free parallax scrolling theme, or install a dedicated plugin.

            One of the best things about WordPress is that it’s highly customizable and flexible. Each of these options
            will get you a similar, if not identical, result.

            If you want to have utmost flexibility, though, we recommend going with the HTML and CSS coding route. You
            can finetune your code without needing to switch to another theme or install a plugin that may slow down
            your site. You might want to add parallax scrolling to a single page. If that’s the case, we’ve got you
            covered. In the case of a plugin, you can add a shortcode to the individual page’s content.

            In the case of a parallax theme, you’ll be able to toggle parallax options on a page-by-page basis.

            If you want to use HTML & CSS, the steps are nearly identical to item #1 above, only you won’t edit your
            theme files.

            First, navigate to the page you want to edit by clicking Pages > All Pages on your admin sidebar.

            Next, switch from the visual editor to the code editor. On Gutenberg, you find this option by clicking the
            three dots on the top right corner, navigating down to Editor, and clicking Code Editor. <br><br>
            Parallax… It sounds beautiful, interesting and maybe a little bit mysterious, and that’s exactly how it
            looks on websites. Parallax scrolling is one of the techniques used to make your website attractive and
            eye-catching for your visitors.

            Originating from video games, Parallax has long since become a web design trend. Its secret is in multiple
            backgrounds moving at different speeds during web page scrolling. This adds depth to the website and creates
            a pseudo 3D effect, providing an interesting and engaging user experience.

            Most visitors want to be entertained by the websites they visit. That’s something that Parallax does
            perfectly. It’s always better to see examples instead of thousands of words, isn’t it? Parallax Scrolling is
            one of the latest trends in web design, yet most parallax scrolling websites are not SEO-friendly. I have
            observed this trend on sites like Awwwards, theFWA and many more. I have also observed that there are many
            articles that say parallax scrolling is not ideal for search engines. Parallax Scrolling is a design
            technique and it is ideal for search engines if you know how to apply it. I have collected a list of great
            tutorials and real SEO-friendly parallax websites to help the community learn how to use both techniques
            together. There appears to be lots of confusion in the community and I want to clear it up.
